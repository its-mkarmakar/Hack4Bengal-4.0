## üìå Problem Statement


**The problem Resonanze solves**

High Voice Strain Among Professionals ‚Äì Teachers, singers, content creators, and public speakers rely on their voice daily, making them highly susceptible to vocal fatigue and long-term damage.

Lack of Preventive Care ‚Äì Many voice professionals only seek medical attention when issues become severe, as there is no easy-to-use tool for continuous vocal health monitoring.

No Personalized Feedback System ‚Äì There is no AI-driven solution that provides real-time feedback on vocal strain, tone, and overall voice health tailored to individual needs.

Inefficient Healthcare Support ‚Äì ENT specialists and vocal coaches lack a centralized system to track a patient‚Äôs vocal health history, making diagnosis and treatment less effective.

Need for a Subscription-Based AI Solution ‚Äì Professionals need an affordable, scalable, and easily accessible tool that integrates with their daily routine, providing actionable insights and helping prevent long-term voice-related health issues.
